# ðŸ¤° Maternal Health Risk Prediction using Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms

This project applies various machine learning models to predict maternal health risks using clinical data. It also demonstrates the use of Genetic Algorithms for optimizing Decision Tree hyperparameters.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Genetic Algorithm for Decision Tree tuning
- Multiple models: Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost
- Accuracy comparison and test evaluation
- Dataset includes vital signs and risk classification

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

Includes medical features like:
- Systolic/Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Blood Glucose Level
- Heart Rate
- Risk Level (Target Label)

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `xgboost`
- `random`

## ðŸ’» How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maternal-health-risk-ml-ga.git
cd maternal-health-risk-ml-ga
jupyter notebook Med.ipynb
